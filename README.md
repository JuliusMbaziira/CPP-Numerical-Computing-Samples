# CPP-Numerical-Computing-Samples

Samples C++ Numerical Computing, including implementations for Benchmarking CUDA and OpenMP. These samples include:  

1. An implementation for the Runge Kutta Fourth Order method (ODE Solver). 
2. An implementation for a Particle System Solver, Discrete Element/Particle Method (DEM/DPM) based on Euler's Method.
3. An implementation for OpenMP Benchmarking (For Scheduling DEM Force Calculations).
4. An implementation for GPU Benchmarking (CUDA Performance Diagnostics For Computational Efficiency).
