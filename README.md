# CPP-Numerical-Computing-Samples

These are some of the Numerical and Parallel Computing samples I've implemented in C++, including Benchmarking/Performance evaluation codes for CUDA and OpenMP. They include:  

1. An implementation for the Runge Kutta Fourth Order method (ODE Solver). 

2. An implementation for a Particle System Solver, Discrete Element/Particle Method (DEM/DPM) based on Euler's Method.

3. An implementation for OpenMP Benchmarking (For Scheduling DEM Force Calculations).

4. An implementation for GPU Benchmarking (CUDA Performance Diagnostics For Computational Efficiency).
